* Open Workbench
* Navigate to menu **Database** > **Reverse Engineer...**
* Choose the connection, **Next**
* Wait and **Next**
* Select the datbase you want to create ERR diagram from, **Next**
* Wait and **Next**
* Select tables that you want to include in the ERR diagram, **Execute>**
* Wait and **Next**

You have a new ERR diagram, you can generate the documentation from this diagram as the previous step.


After that, you can convert the output Markdown document into any format that you want.
